# Disinfecting filters with heat

UV disinfection is probably the best method for larger organizations with a good capacity to ensure continuous availability and effectiveness of devices and lights necessary for the technique. If UV is not available, heat treatment at 70–75°C for a period of 60 minutes will inactivate viruses completely. In Darnell’s study on the SARS virus of 2004, 45 minutes at 75°C was sufficient. We’ve extended the time in this protocol to allow for heat at 70°C as well.

This temperature can be achieved with a rice cooker on the ‘keep warm’ setting. The ‘cook’ setting will melt the filter.

# Caring for your filters

As per guidelines from the CDC on extended use of N95 filters, here is some guidance.

Discard N95 filters in these scenarios:

 * Obviously damaged
 * Difficult to breathe through
 * When notably/visibly contaminated (blood, secretions, bodily fluids)

How to protect your respirator from contamination:

 * Use a cleanable face shield
 * Give the patient a regular surgical mask
 * Hand hygiene before and after touching N95 respirator (if needed for improved fit/comfort)
